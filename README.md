# Python LeetCode Practice

## Objective
This repository contains my Python solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by problem number and title. I am using the [LeetSync Chrome Extension](https://github.com/LeetSync/LeetSync) to sync my submissions directly from LeetCode to this GitHub repository.

## Overview

Each problem is organized in its own folder, named after the LeetCode problem's number and title (e.g., `1-two-sum`). Each folder contains:
- A `README.md` file with a brief explanation of the problem and approach.
- A `.py` file with the Python solution to the problem.

The repository is continuously updated with new solutions using LeetSync, which ensures that my LeetCode submissions are synced efficiently.
